Model: U-Net

Dataset: Kvasir-SEG

Kvasir-SEG is a publicly available colonoscopy image segmentation dataset comprising
1,000 polyp images with corresponding ground-truth masks. The dataset is compact (~46
MB) and well-suited for experimental studies. All annotations were manually delineated by a
medical expert and subsequently verified by an experienced gastroenterologist, ensuring
high-quality and clinically reliable segmentations.
The dataset is available at: https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir-seg/. In this project, students
are required to partition the dataset into 70% for training and 30% for validation when
conducting their experiments, in order to ensure consistency and comparability across
results.
